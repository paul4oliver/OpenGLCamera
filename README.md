# OpenGLCamera

The goal of this project was to introduce creating interactive cameras. 

I have multiple primitives in this scene! A step up from my pyramid last week. I now use draw arrays instead of draw elements.
Each primitve has its own VAO and VBO. I am still learning how to make a cylinder. 

Allow user to move around 3D scene use the keyboard, mouse, and movement combinations below:

WASD keys:  used to control the forward, backward, left, and right motion
QE keys:  used to control the upward and downward movement
Mouse cursor:  used to change the orientation of the camera so it can look up and down or right and left
Mouse scroll:  used to adjust the speed of the movement, or the speed the camera travels around the scene

Additionally, pressing 'P' will change projection matrix between perspective and orthographic view.
